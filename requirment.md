Hi Evgeniy! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the team.



There are some minor issues with adding you to the project repository, but this will be resolved shortly. In the meantime, here is your first task:



Task



You will work on developing the ProtoCheck interface according to the Figma designs.



- Our developer Kennedy has already implemented the backend part and started working on the interface.
- Your task is to continue developing the interface, integrating the functionality he built.
- Please note that his work is still under review, so if anything is missing, feel free to ask in the group.



Instructions



1. The interface must support 15 languages and 3 styles. You will find separate files for them in the corresponding directories.
2. The backend part of ProtoCheck is located at:
neuro_core/neuropacks/health/protocheck
Start building the interface in your own folder there. You will also find README files to guide you.
3. Add the required 3D elements, animations, and the 3D robot hand cursor. Please ask Kostiantyn to share these with you, as he is responsible for them.
4. Before each update, please provide screenshots or video recordings showing what exactly has been done, so we can clearly track progress.
5. Follow the general coding style â€” check how other interface pages have been implemented, as this will help you stay consistent.



Deadline
The deadline is September 20. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out at any time.



Thank you, and best of luck with your work! ðŸš€

Please also provide your GitHub username so I can add you to the project repository.
Iâ€™ve already created a branch for you: dev/evgeniy â€” please work within it.
